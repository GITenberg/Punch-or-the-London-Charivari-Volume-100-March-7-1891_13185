    <h2>VOCES POPULI.</h2>

    <h3>IN A FOG.&mdash;A REMINISCENCE OF THE PAST MONTH.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>Main Thoroughfare near Hyde Park. Time 8
        P.M. Nothing visible anywhere, but very much audible;
        horses slipping and plunging, wheels grinding, crashes,
        jolts, and English as she is spoke on such
        occasions.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mrs. Flusters</i> (<i>who is seated in a brougham with
    her husband, on their way to dine with some friends in Cromwell
    Road</i>). We shall be dreadfully late, I know we shall! I'm
    sure PEACOCK could go faster than this if he liked&mdash;he
    always loses his head when there's much traffic. Do tell him to
    make haste!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> Better let him alone&mdash;he knows what he's
    doing.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. F.</i> I don't believe he does, or he wouldn't
    dawdle like this. If you won't speak to him, I must. (<i>Lets
    down the glass and puts out her head.</i>) PEACOCK!</p>

    <p><i>A Blurred Shadow on the Box.</i> Yes, M'm.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. F.</i>. What are we stopping for like this?</p>

    <p><i>The Shadow</i>. Fog very thick just 'ere, M'm. Can't see
    what's in front of us, M'm.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. F.</i> It's just as safe to keep moving as to stand
    still&mdash;go on at once.</p>

    <p><i>The S.</i> Very good, M'm. (<i>To horse.</i>) Pull urp!
    [<i>Crash!</i></p>

    <p><i>Voice from the Unseen</i>. What the blanky blank,
    &amp;c.</p>

    <p><i>Peacock</i>. There <i>is</i> suthin in front, M'm. A van,
    from 'is langwich, M'm.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. F.</i> (<i>sinking back</i>). MARMADUKE, this is
    awful. I'd no idea the fog was like this&mdash;or I should
    never have&mdash;(<i>With temper.</i>) Really, people have no
    <i>right</i> to ask one out on such a night.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> (<i>with the common-sense that makes him "so
    aggravating at times."</i>) Well, FANNY, you could hardly
    expect 'em to foresee the weather three weeks ahead!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. F.</i> At all events, <i>you</i> might have seen
    what it was going to be as you came home from the Temple. Then
    we could have sent a telegram!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> It seemed to be lifting then, and besides,
    I&mdash;ah&mdash;regard a dinner-engagement as a species of
    kindly social contract, not to be broken except under pressing
    necessity.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. F.</i> You mean you heard me say there was nothing
    but cold meat in the house, and you know you'll get a good
    dinner at the CORDON-BLEWITTS,&mdash;not that we are likely to
    get there to-night. Have you any idea whereabouts we are?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> (<i>calmly</i>). None whatever.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. F.</i> Then ask PEACOCK.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> (<i>lets down his window, and leans out</i>).
    PEACOCK!</p>

    <p><i>The Shadow</i>. Sir?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> Where have we got to now?</p>

    <p><i>Peacock</i>. I ain't rightly sure, Sir.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. F.</i> Tell him to turn round, and go home.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> It's no use going on like this. Turn back.</p>

    <p><i>Peacock</i>. I dursn't leave the kerb&mdash;all I got to
    go by, Sir.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> Then take one of the lamps, and lead the
    horse.</p>

    <p><i>Peacock</i>. It's the <i>young</i> 'orse, Sir.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> (<i>sinking back</i>). We must put up with it,
    I suppose.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>A smart crack is heard at the back of the
        carriage.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>More Voices</i>. Now, then, why the blanky dash, &amp;c.,
    &amp;c.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. F.</i> MARMADUKE, I can't sit here, and know that a
    bus-pole may come between us at any moment. Let us get out, and
    take a cab home at once.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> There's only one objection to that
    suggestion&mdash;viz., that it's perfectly impossible to tell a
    cab from a piano-organ. We must find out where we are first,
    and then turn. PEACOCK, drive on as well as you can, and stop
    when you come to a shop.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. F.</i> What do you want to stop at a shop for?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> Why, then I can go in, and ask where we
    <i>are</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. F.</i> And how do you expect <i>them</i> to know
    where we are! (<i>She sees a smear of light in the
    distance.</i>) MARMADUKE, there's a linkman. Get out quick, and
    hire him to lead the way.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> (<i>who gets out, and follows in the direction
    of the light, grumbling to himself</i>). Hallo!&mdash;not past
    the Park yet&mdash;here's the railings! Well, if I keep close
    to them, I shall&mdash;(<i>He suddenly collides with a
    bench.</i>) Phew! Oh, confound it! (<i>He rubs his shins.</i>)
    Now, if it hadn't been for FANNY, I&mdash;Where's that linkman?
    Hi!&mdash;you there!&mdash;stop! (<i>The light stops.</i>) Look
    here&mdash;I want you to come to my carriage, and show my man
    the way out of this!</p>

    <p><i>Voice from behind the Railings</i>. We got to find our
    <i>own</i> way out fust, Guv'nor. We're <i>inside</i>!</p>

    <p><i>A Belated Reveller</i> (<i>lurching up to Mr. F.</i>) Beg
    your pardon, bur cou' you dreck me nearesht
    way&mdash;er&mdash;Dawshon Plashe?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> (<i>savagely</i>). First turning to the right,
    third to the left, and then straight on till you come to
    it!</p>

    <p><i>The B.R.</i>. I'm exsheedingly 'blished;
    (<i>confidentially</i>) fact ish, I'm shuffrin' shli' 'fection
    eyeshi', an' I 'shure you, can't shee anyshing dishtingly
    to-ni'. (<i>He cannons against a lamp-post, to which he clings
    affectionately, as a Policeman emerges from the gloom.</i>)</p>

    <p><i>Policeman</i>. Now then, what are you doing 'ere, eh?</p>

    <p><i>The B.R.</i> Itsh all ri', P'lishman, thish
    gerrilman&mdash;(<i>patting lamp-post
    affectionately</i>)&mdash;has kindly promished shee me
    home.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> Hang it! Where's PEACOCK and the brougham?
    (<i>He discovers a phantom vehicle by the kerb, and gets in
    angrily.</i>) Now, look here, my dear, it's no earthly
    good&mdash;!</p>

    <p><i>Occupant of the Brougham</i> (<i>who is</i> not FANNY).
    Coward, touch a defenceless woman if you dare! I have nothing
    on me of any value. Help! Police!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[Mr. F., <i>seeing that explanation is useless, lets
        himself out again, precipitately, dodges the</i> Policeman,
        <i>and bolts, favoured by the fog, until all danger of
        pursuit is passed, at the end of which time he suddenly
        realises that it is perfectly hopeless to attempt to find
        his own carriage again. He gropes his way home, and some
        hours later, after an extemporised cold supper, is rejoined
        by his Wife.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mrs. F.</i> (<i>cheerfully</i>). So there you are,
    MARMADUKE! I wasn't anxious&mdash;I felt sure you'd find your
    way back somehow!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> (<i>not in the best of tempers</i>). Find my
    way back! It was the only thing I could do. But where have
    <i>you</i> been all this time, FANNY?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. F.</i> Where? Why, at the BLEWITTS, to be sure! You
    see, after you got out, we had to keep moving on, and by-and-by
    the fog got better, and we could see where we were going
    to,&mdash;and the BLEWITTS had put off dinner half an hour, so
    I was not so <i>very</i> late. Such a <i>nice</i> dinner!
    Everybody turned up except <i>you</i>, MARMADUKE&mdash;but I
    <i>told</i> them how it was. Oh, and old Lady HOREHOUND was
    there, and said a man had actually got into her brougham, and
    tried to wrench off one of her bracelets!&mdash;only she spoke
    to him so severely that he was struck with remorse, or
    something, and got out again! And it was by the Park,
    <i>close</i> to where you left me. Just fancy, MARMADUKE, he
    might have got into the carriage with <i>me</i>, instead!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> (<i>gloomily</i>). Yes, he
    <i>might</i>&mdash;only, he&mdash;er&mdash;<i>didn't</i>, you
    know!</p>

        <p>"110-Ton Guns do not count for any practical purpose....
        These monsters are the laughing-stock of everyone who takes
        the smallest interest in the subject. They are quite
        indefensible, and not worth making, even if they were
        unobjectionable, for the simple reason that everything we
        require can be done by smaller weapons.... It is believed
        that more of these useless monsters are to be made by way
        of reserve. It is an insane policy, designed simply to save
        somebody's <i>amour propre</i>, and we still hope to hear
        from Lord GEORGE HAMILTON that it has been
        abandoned."&mdash;"<i>The Times" on the Naval
        Estimates</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>"That a good little 'un is better than a bad big 'un," is an
    old and accepted maxim amongst the really knowing ones of the
    P.R. It is one, however, that now, as of yore, swell backers,
    self-conceited amateurs, and other pugilistic jugginses ore apt
    to ignore or forget.</p>

    <p>Where, we wonder, would the slab-sided "Sprawleybridge Babe"
    or the shambling "Baldnob the Titan" have been in front of the
    small but active and accomplished "Duodecimo Dumps"? Why, where
    the vaunted "Benicia Boy" would have been after fifty rounds
    with TOM SAYERS&mdash;<i>with</i> his "Auctioneer" in full
    play. In fact, when a good little 'un meets a bad big 'un, it
    is very soon a case&mdash;with the latter&mdash;of "bellows to
    mend," or "there he goes; with his eye out!"</p>

    <p>These remarks have been suggested by recent revelations
    concerning that much over-rated pet of the mugs&mdash;the
    "Woolwich Whopper," <i>alias</i> the "Elswick Folly,"
    <i>alias</i> HAMILTON's "Novice."</p>

    <p>The "W.W." always <i>was</i> a fraud, and, for all his
    lumbering bulk and "MOLINEAUX-like" capacity of "tatur-trap,"
    never <i>could</i> train-on soundly, or&mdash;figuratively
    speaking&mdash;"spank a hole in a pound of butter." Many
    cleverish trainers, and still more ambitious backers
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"
       id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span> of the "Corinthian Jay"
       species, have had a shy, professionally or monetarily, at
       the "Woolwich Whopper," and invariably with disastrous
       results. The "W.W.," though big enough in all conscience, is
       not of sound constitution, nor of the true wear-and-tear
       sort, is very difficult (<i>and</i> expensive) to train, and
       when brought fairly up to the scratch is certain to go bang
       to pieces after the first few rounds, if these are at all of
       a hot-and-hot character.</p>

    <p>Still there are&mdash;worse luck!&mdash;certain parties
    connected, more or less, with the P.R. who&mdash;whether from
    interest, vanity, or sheer cussedness, still pin their faith to
    this "huge, lumbering, soft, long-shanked, top-heavy,
    shambling, thump-shirking Son of a Gun," as NOBBY NUPKINS, of
    the Nautical Division, pithily called him the other day. If
    some of these credulous or conceited coves had witnessed the
    little trial "scrap" which took place recently (on the strict
    Q.T.), at the "Admiral's Head," in the presence of Mr. JOHN
    B-LL (the famous P.R. referee), between the vaunted "Whopper"
    and a smart and handy light-weight known as "Quickfire," their
    owl-eyes might, having been a little opened, and their
    peacock-strut a bit modified.</p>

    <p>The "Woolwich Whopper," for all his height and overwhelming
    weight, seemed to toe the scratch with awkward reluctance. He
    put up his dukes very fumblingly, and his attitude was
    decidedly of the "head-over-tip" character. Young "Quickfire,"
    on the contrary, was erect as a dart, nimble on his pins as a
    girl at her first dance, and smart in delivery as a
    newly-promoted Postman, or the Parcels Express. He was all over
    his man in a brace of shakes, and the "Whopper," who looked as
    though he could have knocked holes in him <i>if</i> he could
    have hit him, could hardly land a "little one in" once in the
    course of a round, and then it was so short that it would
    hardly have brushed a bumble-bee off a buttercup.</p>

    <p>The respected Referee, who watched the dust-up with careful
    interest, was much pleased with the promise of the smart
    light-weight, "Quickfire," who seems to have in him the makings
    of a fine fighter. Mr. B-LL did not disguise his disgust at the
    feeble figure cut by the "Whopper," about whose pretensions to
    first-class form, let alone Champion honours, it is to be hoped
    we shall hear little more for the future.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p><i>The Quiet Mrs. Fleming</i> is very nearly being a good
    novel of the kind with which "once upon a time" Mr. F.C.
    PHILIPS used to delight us. Mr. RICHARD PRYCE's <i>Quiet Mrs.
    F.</i> might perhaps be placed in the same category with
    F.C.P.'s. <i>Little Mrs. Murray</i>, which was not by any means
    the Author's best. The story, like the Consols, is good enough
    for those who don't want much interest for their money. It may
    be safely recommended as a pleasant companion during a railway
    journey. The Baron does not consider that <i>The Quiet Mrs.
    F.</i> will make much noise in the novel-reading world.</p>

    <p>A coloured leaflet, of autumnal tint, commands me, in the
    tone of a Wellington dispatch, to "order early" a new "Family
    Magazine," entitled, <i>Golden Gates</i>, edited by JOHN
    STRANGE WINTER. "I have not yet seen it," says the Baron, "but
    wish the adventurous pennyworth every possible success." Its
    bill of contents announces "a complete story," by the editress,
    and also a "complete novelette," by Mrs. LOVETT CAMERON. This
    looks well for the first number; and an editor's motto must be,
    "Take care of Number One." I suppose in each number there will
    be "A Winter's Tale."</p>

    <p>Interesting reading for the Baron and his friends the
    Public, is Mr. ANDERSON's article, entitled <i>Studies in
    Illustrated Journalism</i>, in this month's <i>Magazine of
    Art</i>. Mr. ANDERSON is a trifle inaccurate in some details of
    his pleasantly-written and generally trustworthy sketch of the
    history of <i>Mr. Punch</i>, on which it is needless for the
    Baron to dwell <i>hic et nunc</i>. The Baron remembers the
    dapper, sportingly-attired "little HOWARD," who had the
    reputation of being "LEECH's only pupil," but who was never one
    of <i>Mr. Punch's</i> Staff Officers. In the same number of
    this Magazine is a brief, but carefully written notice of the
    Baron's old friend, <i>convive</i>, and fellow-worker on <i>Mr.
    Punch's</i> staff, CHARLES KEENE. "A superb Artist," writes Mr.
    SPIELMAN, "pure and simple"&mdash;true this, in every
    sense&mdash;"the greatest master of line in black and white
    that will live for many years to come." The engraving that
    accompanies this notice of our old friend is not a striking
    likeness of "CARLO," but it exactly reproduces his thoughtful
    attitude, with his pipe in his hand, so familiar to all his
    associates.</p>

    <p>Hereby and herewith thanks-a-many are returned to the
    "Bibliographer," who is also the Secretary of the Sette of Odd
    Volumes, for his charming little <i>brochure</i> about

    <p>SONOGUN scarcely knew what to do. He had been up all day,
    wandering about the lanes which surrounded the family mansion.
    A fitful light blazed in his magnificent eyes, his brow
    contracted until it assumed that peculiarly battered expression
    which is at once characteristic of a bent penny and consistent
    with the most sublime beauty. To be properly appreciated he
    must be adequately described. Imagine then a young man of
    twenty, who was filled with the bitterest hatred of the world,
    which he had forsworn two years ago, on being expelled from
    school for gambling. There was about him an air of haughty
    reserve and of indifference which was equally haughty. This it
    was his habit to assume in order to meet any neighbours who
    happened to meet him, and the result naturally was that he was
    not so popular as some inferior beings who were less haughty.
    In fact he had a very short way with his relations, for whose
    benefit he kept a shell into which he frequently retired. He
    was dangerously handsome, in the Italian style, and often
    played five bars of music over and over again, with one finger,
    to please his mother. Some women thought he was an Apollo,
    others described him as an Adonis, but everybody invariably
    ended or began by calling him an ancient Roman. He was
    sarcastic, satiric, and very strong. Indeed, on one occasion,
    he absolutely broke the feathers on a hand-screen, and on
    another he cracked three walnuts in succession without looking
    up. But, oh, the sufferings that young heart had undergone.
    Slapped by his nurse, reproved by his mother, expelled by his
    schoolmaster, and shunned by the society of the country-side,
    it was small wonder that the brave soul revolted against its
    fellow-men, and set its jaws in a proud resolve to lash the
    unfeeling world with the contempt of a spirit bruised beyond
    the power of such lotions as the worldly-wise recommended for
    the occasion. He whistled to his dog <i>Stray</i>, and clenched
    his fists in impotent anger. An expression of gentleness stole
    over his features. The idea was suggestive. He, too, the proud,
    the honourable, the upright would steal, and thus punish the
    world. He looked into his make-up box. It contained bitter
    defiance, angry scorn, and a card-sharper's pack of cards. He
    took them out; and thus SONOGUN, the expelled atheist, made up
    his mind.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

    <p>On the green table of life the cards fall in many ways, and
    the proud king often has to bow his head before the meek and
    unassuming ace.&mdash;BINNS.</p>

    <p>AND now began for SONOGUN a time of moral stress and torture
    such as he had never anticipated. It is an old saying, and
    perhaps (who knows?) a truism, that virtue is its own reward,
    not, perhaps, the reward that ambitious people look for, but
    the easy consciousness of superiority which comes to those who
    feel themselves to be on a higher level than the rest of the
    world, which struggles on a lower level. Another philosopher,
    nameless, but illustrious, has declared, in burning words, that
    "Honesty is the best policy," best in some form, perhaps hardly
    understood now, but no less real because we are unable to
    appraise it in the current coin of the realm over which Her
    Most Gracious Majesty, whom may Heaven preserve, holds sway.
    But SONOGUN had never thought of Heaven. To him, young, proud,
    gloomy, and moody, Heaven had seemed only&mdash;(Several
    chapters of theological disquisition omitted.&mdash;ED.) The
    click of the billiard-balls maddened him, the sight of a cue
    made him rave like a maniac. One evening he was walking
    homeward to Drury Lane. He had given his coat to a
    hot-potato-man, deeming it, in his impulsive way, a bitter
    satire on the world's neglect, that the senseless tubers should
    have jackets, while their purveyor lacked a coat. The rain was
    pouring down, but it mattered little to him. He had wrapped
    himself in that impenetrable mantle of cold scorn, and thus he
    watched with a moody air the crowd of umbrella-carrying
    respectabilities, who hurried on their way without a thought of
    him. Suddenly some one slapped him on the back, and, as he
    turned round, he found himself face to face with a couple of
    seedy-looking gentlemen.</p>

    <p>"I perceive," began SONOGUN, "that you hate the world,
    having suffered much injustice from it."</p>

    <p>"We do; we have!" was the cordial reply.</p>

    <p>"I, too," continued SONOGUN, "have many grievances. But tell
    me who and what are you?"</p>

    <p>"Our names are unknown even to ourselves," replied his new
    friends, for friends he felt them to be. "By profession we are
    industrial knights. That should be sufficient.</p>

    <p>"It is;&mdash;more than sufficient," said the proud,
    honourable young man, "I will be one of you. We will take it
    out of the world together."</p>

    <p>The bargain thus made was soon ratified. They procured
    cards, SONOGUN whistled to his dog <i>Stray</i>, and they all
    set out together to the nearest railway station to pick up
    their victims. This is the usual method, and thus card-sharpers
    are manufactured.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">

    doing.&mdash;JAKES.</p></blockquote>

    <p>In the meantime, SONOGUN's cousin, ACIS ARRANT, generally
    known to his jocular intimates as Knave ARRANT, had been living
    in luxury with his cousin's weak mother, whom he had contrived
    to marry. To effect this, however, he had been compelled to
    tear a will into little pieces, and had, at the same time,
    ruined that peace of his mind which he often gave to SONOGUN.
    The unfortunate consequence was, that SONOGUN did not value it
    in the least, and always returned it to him. And thus the
    relations of the two men, who should have been friends, the
    guardian and the ward, were always on a hostile footing, which
    only the most delicate handling could have healed. ACIS was not
    happy. When his glass told him he was old, he had no repartee
    ready, and could only speculate gloomily on the disagreeable
    fate which had compelled him to take part in a modern novel,
    and had evidently told him off to pass away into the unseen in
    Chapter 40.</p>

    <p>But, of course, GLADYS and her father, the doctor, knew
    nothing <span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"
       id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span> about all this. GLADYS
       always looked happy; her hair, her mouth, her eyes, her
       ears, even her little unformed nose, all looked as happy as
       possible. She was a pleasant little patent moraliser, with a
       double escapement action for great occasions. On this
       evening all the family was gathered together, including the
       inevitable infant, whose prattle serves to soothe the gloomy
       perversity of morose heroes. On such an evening as this
       SONOGUN had seen them all years ago, and, though he was
       standing in the garden and all the windows were shut, he had
       heard every single whisper of the family conversation. The
       Doctor seemed to be troubled, and GLADYS came up to him in
       her caressing way.</p>

    <p>"My dear," he said, simply, "SONOGUN is in trouble, and we
    must rescue him." No more was said, but the next moment GLADYS
    and her father had left by the London express.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>All things are fair that are not dark;</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>SONOGUN had seen a notice in a railway-carriage. "Beware of
    card-sharpers" was printed upon it, and it flashed upon him,
    with the force of a revelation, that it must be meant for him.
    Once more he made up his mind. He would fly. Fear lent him a
    spare pair of second-hand wings. He whistled to his dog
    <i>Stray</i>, and having thrown HAECKEL and RENAN out of the
    window, he flapped twice, and then soared up, <i>Stray</i>
    following as best he could. It was very dark, and the clouds
    were threatening. For a long time he avoided them, but at
    length he fell into a particularly damp one, and would
    inevitably have been drowned, had not the sagacious
    <i>Stray</i> brought men to his assistance. And thus SONOGUN,
    the scoffer, the agnostic, the moody, gloomy, morose,
    cast-iron, Roman-faced misanthrope, got home. That same evening
    he changed his clothes and his character, and on the following
    day married GLADYS.</p>

    <p>The fencing Lecture, entitled, <i>The Story of
    Swordsmanship</i>, seems to have been so great a success, last
    Wednesday, at the Lyceum, as to have aroused the ire of some
    Music-hall Managers, who earnestly contend that the Stage of
    the Theatre, that is, of the Drama <i>pur et simple</i>, very
    pure <i>et</i> very simple, should not be used or misused for
    the purpose of giving an entertainment, which, though given
    without scenes, was yet "illustrated with cuts."</p>

    <p>It is highly probable that this offensive and defensive
    subject will be followed by other lectures more, perhaps, in
    keeping with theatrical tradition. We will not give our
    authority for this statement, but may intimate that that
    eminent professor of the P.R. and P.M.N.A.S.D., known within
    certain circles as <i>The Slogger</i>, will, at no very distant
    date, give at one of our most popular theatres a lecture, the
    first of a series, on <i>Pugilism and the Drama</i>.</p>

    <p>Tickets, of course, to be obtained at the Box-office. The
    subject of the first Lecture will be <i>Box and Fighting
    Cocks</i>.</p>

    <p>Among other things the eloquent professor will draw the
    attention of his audience to what a change in the history of
    the Stage, nay, perhaps, in the history of the world, would
    have occurred if to <i>Box's</i> inquiry as to his pugilistic
    capacity, <i>Cox</i> had replied, "I can!" and had there and
    then thrown himself, like <i>Mr. Pickwick</i> "into a paralytic
    attitude," and exclaimed, "Come on!" an invitation which the
    challenger would have been bound in honour to accept. The
    Lecturer will practically show how "to make a hit," and give an
    example from the life of the "early closing movement." The
    Lecture will be interspersed with songs, such as "<i>Black Eyes
    and Blue Eyes</i>," "<i>Hand and Glove</i>," "<i>Ring!
    Ring!</i>" "<i>The Hymn to Floorer</i>" a part-song, by four
    choristers, and "<i>Me-fist-O's song</i>" from <i>Faust</i>.
    Perhaps the next Lecture on the some subject will be given at
    <i>The Umpire Theatre</i>.</p>

    <h2>SHAKSPEARE AND THE UNMUSICAL GLASSES.</h2>

    <p>Mr. PINERO, in his letter to the <i>D.T.</i>, complained
    that, should the Music Halls obtain their wicked way, through
    the incompetence of the County Council to deal with the
    matter&mdash;(but is not DRURIOLANUS a Counti-Counciliarius,
    and ready to see justice done to the poor player, author, (and
    manager alike? Sure-ly!)&mdash;then a play at a Hall of Music
    (they used to be "Caves of Harmony" in THACKERAY's time, and
    the principal Hall of Music was SAM HALL) will be heard between
    "a puff at a cigar and a sip from a glass." Well, but what
    piece can get on without a puff or so? Would not a good cigar
    during a good piece be on additional "draw?" We have "Smoking
    Concerts"; why not "Smoking Theatricals"? <i>But how about the
    Ladies?</i> Years ago there were no smoking-carriages on the
    Railways. And what nowadays is the proportion of smoking to
    non-smoking compartments? Very small. The Ladies will decide
    this question. <i>But how about the Actors?</i> In modern
    pieces they never lose an opportunity of smoking. Why shouldn't
    the cigar be introduced into Shakspearian revivals? Anachronism
    to the winds!&mdash;which is a polite way of expressing
    "Anachronism be blowed!" 'Baccy be blowed too. Sir WALTER
    RALEIGH would have approved its introduction in Elizabethan
    days. In <i>Twelfth Night</i> for example, the line, "Help me
    to some light," is suggestive; so, also, in
    <i>Macbeth</i>&mdash;"Give us a light, then"&mdash;out comes
    the cigar. <i>Titus Andronicus</i> might be revived, with a
    view to inaugurating the innovation, and the line, "Some of you
    shall smoke," would be the signal for the production of many a
    cigar-case in point. <i>Hamlet</i> could, perhaps, find some
    authority for reading the line, "Will you play upon this pipe?"
    as, "Will you smoke this pipe?" And the other actor would
    reply, "Certainly&mdash;and thank you, my Lord, I have one of
    my own." Mr. EDWARD TERRY has no objection to <i>The
    Churchwarden</i> in his theatre, and his Churchwarden drew very
    well. However, we've had this discussion before. Will it end
    this time, as it has hitherto done, in smoke? Let us suppose a
    Shakspearian play under the proposed conditions:&mdash;</p>

    <p class="author">HUKIEWAUKIE, <i>February</i> 28.</p>

    <p>An extraordinary incident has just stirred the heart of this
    populous Western centre to its depths. Some fifteen years ago
    Colonel ZACHARY B. DIBBS, one of the most prominent citizens of
    Hukiewaukie (then a mere collection of log-huts), disappeared
    without leaving any address to which his letters and papers
    were to be forwarded. Mrs. DIBBS, who was then about to give
    birth to the seventh scion of the house of DIBBS, was
    inconsolable, and ordered the fish-ponds in the vicinity to be
    subjected to a rigorous scrutiny. All her conjugal efforts
    proved fruitless, the missing Colonel was nowhere to be found,
    and, after a decent interval spent in the wearing of widow's
    weeds, Mrs. DIBBS was led to the local registrar's office by
    Sheriff's Deputy ORLANDO T. STRUGGLES. Time went on, and five
    flourishing STRUGGLESES were added by the former Mrs. DIBBS to
    the population of the town. On Thursday last, however, Colonel
    DIBBS was discovered by his eldest son, Mr. JERNIAH N. DIBBS,
    the well-known notary public, sitting in his familiar seat in
    the Fifth Street Saloon, drinking rum-shrub out of a tumbler.
    An explanation followed. Sheriff's Deputy STRUGGLES, in the
    handsomest manner, offered to resign all claim to the
    possession of the Colonel's spouse. The Colonel, however, would
    not hear of this. Finally it was decided to spin a five-dollar
    green-back for the lady. An inopportune gust of wind, however,
    carried off the fateful money, and the momentous question is
    still undecided. The Colonel has announced his intention of
    continuing a bachelor, even if he has to fight the matter up to
    the Supreme Court, and a large majority of the inhabitants of
    the town are willing to support him, with a view to making this
    a test case.</p>

    <p class="author">MUNCHAUSENVILLE, <i>March</i> 2.</p>

    <p>Yesterday, as one of the chief tiger-purveyors of this city
    was engaged in exercising his <i>troupe</i> of fiery, untamed
    tigers, in the main street, two of the ferocious animals
    escaped from the string which has usually been found sufficient
    for their confinement. A general stampede of the inhabitants
    immediately followed, the majority finding refuge in the bar of
    the recently constructed Hotel Columbia, Mayor MADDERLEY and
    his amiable consort were, however, not so fortunate. The Mayor,
    being shortsighted, mistook the two denizens of the jungle for
    a couple of performing poodles, to whose training he had
    devoted much of his leisure, and who, as it happened, were at
    that precise moment expected on their return from the
    post-office, with the Mayor's mail in their mouths&mdash;a
    trick which had often amused the Mayor's friends. Mr. MADDERLEY
    advanced to stroke his supposed pets, and was much surprised to
    find himself torn in pieces before he had time to send for the
    city mace. Mrs. MADDERLEY, a stout, plethoric lady, would have
    been the next victim, had she not, with extraordinary presence
    of mind, declared herself dead the moment the animals
    approached her. This deceit (which, however, has been the
    subject of grave censure in many pulpits,) saved her life.
    Maddened by the taste of blood, the tigers next attacked Mr.
    LARIAT's grocery store. Here, however, they met their match in
    an army of Gorgonzola cheeses, which broke from their shelves,
    attacked the intruders with wonderful fury, and in ten minutes
    had so far subdued them that their owner was able to recapture
    them, and lead them home. The obsequies of Mr. MADDERLEY's
    shoes and his umbrella&mdash;all that was left of the unhappy
    Mayor&mdash;have just taken place amidst universal
    demonstrations of sympathy. The funeral <i>cortège</i> took an
    hour to pass a given point. Widow MADDERLEY proposes to sue the
    owner of her late husband's assassins.</p>

    <p class="author">LYNCHVILLE, <i>March</i> 3.</p>

    <p>Two brothers, named respectively JOHN and THOMAS, quarrelled
    here yesterday about the ownership of a clasp-knife. They drew
    their revolvers at the same instant, and fired at a distance of
    two paces. Strangely enough the two deadly bullets met in the
    air, and, their force being exactly equal, they stopped dead
    and dropped to the ground, whence they were afterwards picked
    up and presented to the trustees of the Lynchville Museum of
    Fine Art. Nothing daunted, the fraternal contestants set to
    work with their bowie-knives, and were only separated after
    JOHN had inflicted on THOMAS ten mortal wounds and received
    from him one less. It is generally admitted that nothing could
    have been fairer than the conduct of the police, who formed a
    <i>cordon</i> round the duellists, and thus prevented the fussy
    interference which has so often brought similar affairs to a
    premature termination. The two coffins are to be of polished
    walnut-wood, and will be provided by the Friendly Society to
    which the two deceased belonged, as a last mark of affection
    and regard.</p>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, February</i> 23.&mdash;House
    empty to-night. Even the fog keeps out; nothing more important
    under consideration than Army Vote, including expenditure of
    £5,632,700. "And precious little too," says Colonel LAURIE,
    doing sentry march in the Lobby. "Wages going up everywhere!
    labour of all classes but one paid on higher scale than it used
    to be; but TOMMY ATKINS and his Colonel getting just the same
    now as they did twenty years ago, when living was much cheaper.
    There ought to be a rise all round, and so there would be, if
    the Army, following example of other organised bodies of day
    labourers, were to strike; think I'll mention it at Mess;
    should begin at the top. Why shouldn't the Colonels and
    Generals assemble in their hundreds, march to Hyde Park, where
    H.R.H. would address them from a stoutly-made tub? Moral effect
    would be enormous; shall certainly mention it at Mess. Perhaps,
    could get some practical hints from JOHN BURNS."</p>

    <p>These remarks dropped by the Colonel before debate opened.
    During its progress received support from unexpected quarter.
    HARTINGTON, suddenly waking up from usual nap on Front Bench,
    wanted to know when War Office is going to carry out
    recommendation of Royal Commission on re-organisation of Naval
    and Military Departments? STANHOPE said everything turned upon
    vacancy in post of Commander-in-Chief. When that berth empty,
    the machine would move. No chance of immediate vacancy; the
    DOOK very comfortable where he is; not the sort of man to
    retire in face of enemy. The only way to carry out scheme
    recommended by Commissioners after prolonged inquiry was to get
    rid of the DOOK.</p>

    <p>"I do trust," said STANHOPE, winking at the Strangers'
    Gallery, "that the public will not interfere in this matter.
    They have had the Report of the Commission in their hands for
    months. They have taken no notice of it, or any action upon it.
    I do hope, now their attention has been called to the matter by
    my noble and Radical friend opposite, they will not get up a
    fuss and insist that necessary and important reforms in the
    Army shall not be indefinitely postponed in order that the DOOK
    may draw his salary and enjoy his position. If the great mass
    of public opinion outside the Army plainly declared their
    wishes in that direction, we should have to yield; but, as I
    said before," and once more the Secretary furtively dropped his
    left eyelid as he looked up at the Strangers' Gallery, "I hope
    the public will not change their attitude on this subject."</p>

    <p>"That's all very well," said LAURIE, who had now entered the
    House. "But it seems to me that when H.R.H. reads this curious
    speech, he'll be more inclined to fall in with our movement. In
    my mind's eye, I can already see him on the tub in Hyde Park,
    haranguing the mob of Colonels from under an umbrella."</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Army Estimates in Committee.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Decidedly a Labour night, with Capital
    incidentally mentioned. First, OLD MORALITY announces
    appointment of Royal Commission to inquire into relations
    between Capital and Labour. His placid mind evidently disturbed
    by undesirable coincidence. On Saturday night, GRANDOLPH,
    suddenly remembering he had constituents at West Paddington,
    took a penny Road Car, and paid them visit. Delivered luminous
    speech on things in general.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"
       id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span> Recommended appointment of
       Royal Commission on relations between Labour and Capital. To
       uninstructed mind looks uncommonly like as if Ministers,
       reading this speech on Monday morning, had said to each
       other, "Halloa! here's RANDOLPH in the field again. Says we
       must have Labour Commission; suppose we must."</p>

    <p>Nothing of the kind happened. Cabinet Council met at noon on
    Saturday and decided upon Royal Commission. GRANDOLPH didn't
    speak for some hours later. Odd that he should have hit on this
    Commission business; just like his general awkwardness of
    interference. Must prevent all possibility of mistake; so OLD
    MORALITY, in announcing Commission, innocently, but pointedly,
    stops by the way to mention that Ministers had decided upon it
    "last Saturday."</p>

    <p>Wish GRANDOLPH had been here; would like to have seen the
    twinkle in his eye when he heard this little point made. But
    GRANDOLPH busy down by the Docks, picking up his outfit. Secret
    of the sudden and surprising growth of the beard out now.
    GRANDOLPH off to the gold-diggings, and beard usually worn
    there. Hardly knew him when I looked in the other day at
    Connaught Place; trying on his new things; pair of rough
    unpolished boots coming over his knees; belt round his waist
    holding up his trousers and conveniently suspending jackknife,
    tin pannikin, and water-bottle. "For use on the voyage," he
    explains. Then a flannel shirt open at the neck; a wide-awake
    cocked on one side of his head; and a pickaxe on his
    shoulder.</p>

    <p>"I'm tired of civilisation, TOBY, and I am off to the
    diggins. Leave you and OLD MORALITY, and the MARKISS and JACOBY
    to look after politics. As for me, I'm going to look for gold.
    I'm not rushing blindfold into the matter. I've studied it with
    the highest and the deepest authorities&mdash;and what do I
    learn? Native gold is found crystallised in the forms of the
    octahedron, the cube, and the dodecahedron, of which the cube
    is considered as the primary form. It also occurs in filiform,
    capillary, and arborescent shapes, as likewise in leaves or
    membranes, and rolled masses. It offers no indications of
    internal structure, but, on being separated by mechanical
    violence, exhibits a hackly fracture. Its colour comprises
    various shades of gold yellow. Its specific gravity varies from
    14.8 to 19.2. It is commonly alloyed by copper, silver, and
    iron, in very small proportions. I mean, if I may say so, to
    unalloy it"; and, swinging the pick round his head with a
    dexterity that testified to natural aptitude combined with
    diligent practice, GRANDOLPH chipped a fragment out of the
    marble mantelpiece, and, picking it up, eagerly examined it, as
    if in search of a hackly fracture.</p>

    <p>I wished him good luck, and went back to the House, where I
    found BIDDULPH smiling behind SPEAKER's chair, watching
    ATKINSON illustrating the working of his Duration of Speeches
    Bill by ringing a muffin-bell, borrowed from a Constituent.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Miscellaneous.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Should have been at work to-night on
    Army Estimates; but things getting a little mixed. Nearly 150
    Members picknicking at Portsmouth; all the Colonels, the
    Bo'suns, the Captains, and the Admirals.</p>

    <p>"Capital opportunity to get on with the Estimates," JACKSON
    whispered in OLD MORALITY's ear.</p>

    <p>"No," said that pink of chivalry, "I will never take mean
    advantage of a man, even of an Admiral. Let us put on the
    Factories and Workshops Bill; won't take long; keep us going
    till they get back from Portsmouth."</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:20%;">
        <a href="images/120-1.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="'That evening bell!'" /></a>"That evening bell!"
    </div>

    <p>So HOME SECRETARY moved Second Reading. "Mere formality, you
    know," he explained; "shall refer Bill to Committee on Trade,
    and there it will be thrashed out and shaped." But floodgates
    once opened not easily shut. The Factories and Workshops mean
    the Working-Man; Working-Man has Vote; General Election not far
    off; must show Working-Man who's his true friend. Everybody his
    true friend. Speeches by the dozen; COMPTON, after long sitting
    in patient attitude at last caught SPEAKER's eye. "A
    milk-and-water Bill," he scornfully characterised HOME
    SECRETARY's measure.</p>

    <p>"Ah! COMPTON knows what the Working-Man likes," said WILFRID
    LAWSON. "A rum-and-milk Bill is more to <i>his</i> taste."</p>

    <p>LYON PLAYFAIR delivered one of his luminous Lectures; full
    of reference to "certifying surgeons," and "half-time
    children."</p>

    <p>"What's a half-time child?" I asked CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN.</p>

    <p>"Fancy it's one prematurely born," he whispered back. "But
    really don't know; not on in this scene; ask MUNDELLA or
    pleeceman."</p>

    <p>LYON PLAYFAIR knew all about it and much else.</p>

    <p>"Wonderful man!" said the Member for SARK, gazing admiringly
    on his massive brow. "Always reminds me of what SYDNEY SMITH
    said about another eminent person. 'Look at my little friend
    JEFFREY. He hasn't body enough to cover his mind decently with.
    His intellect is indecently exposed.'"</p>

             Opportunity.
    </div>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;PROVAND brought on Motion raising vexed
    question of Taxation of Land. OLD MORALITY always on look-out
    to do kind thing; thought this would be good opportunity of
    trotting out CHAPLIN; had no chance of distinguishing himself
    since he became Minister. So CHAPLIN put up; made mellifluous
    speech. Unfortunately, Mr. G. present; listened to CHAPLIN with
    suspicious suavity; followed him, and, as JEMMY LOWTHER puts
    it, "turned him inside out, and hung him up to dry." Played
    with him like a cat with a mouse; drew him out into damaging
    statements; then danced on his prostrate body. About the worst
    quarter of an hour CHAPLIN ever had in House, with JOKEM on one
    side of him, and OLD MORALITY on other, tossing about on their
    seats, exchanging groans and glances, while CHAPLIN mopped the
    massive brow on which stood forth iridescent gleams of
    moisture.</p>

    <p>"Meant it all for the best," said OLD MORALITY; "but who'd
    have thought of Mr. G. being here? CHAPLIN's a great Minister
    of Agriculture; but, when it comes to questions of finance, not
    quite on a par with Mr. G." <i>Business done</i>.&mdash;House
    Counted Out.</p>

    <h3>CHAMBERS IN ST. JAMES'S STREET.</h3>

    <p><i>THE IDLER</i>, by HADDON CHAMBERS, is a real good play,
    thoroughly interesting from the rising to the setting of the
    Curtain. The parts are artistically adjusted, the dialogue
    unforced, the acting un-stagey, and the situations powerfully
    dramatic. The climax is reached at the "psychological moment,"
    and the Curtain descends upon all that a sympathetic audience
    can possibly desire to know of what must be once and for all
    <i>the</i> story of a life-time. "The rest is silence."
    Throughout the play there is no parade of false sentimentality,
    no tawdry virtue, no copy-book morality, no vicious silliness;
    and, so well constructed is the plot, that there is no need of
    a wearisome extra Act, by way of postscript, to tell us how all
    the characters met again at the North Pole or Land's End; how
    everybody explained everything to everybody else; how the
    Idler, becoming a busy-body, married the widow of <i>Sir John
    Harding, M.P.</i>, who had had the misfortune to be drowned out
    shrimping; and how many other matters happened for which the
    wearied audience would not care one snap of the finger and
    thumb. On another occasion I shall have something to say about
    the acting, which, as far as the men are concerned, has
    certainly not been equalled since the days of <i>Peril</i>. The
    St. James's is in for a good thing with <i>The Idler</i>; and
    at this moment I may say, I would be ALEXANDER were I not,

    <p>ACTING&mdash;ON A SUGGESTION.&mdash;<i>The Woman</i>, always
    well informed, tells us on February 26, that, "owing to
    numerous applications," Mr. C.T. GREIN is negotiating for the
    Royalty Theatre, in order to give another Ibsenian performance.
    Now this is exactly what we suggested in our number for
    February 14. If the date suits, we will go and see
    <i>Ghosts</i>, and, if we succeed in keeping up our spirits
    after seeing <i>Ghosts</i>, we will give a candid opinion on
    the performance of the piece which hitherto we know only in
    print. <i>En attendant</i>, we shall have something to say
    about the recent performance of that piece of Ibsenity <i>A
    Doll's House</i>&mdash;in our next.</p>

    <p>WHAT'S IN A NAME?&mdash;On the recent occasion of the

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
